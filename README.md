# Coding Notes

This repo is the harbour of my code for solving UVa Online Judge problems and Leetcode. Its purpose is to prepare for the Collegiate Programming Examination (CPE) and IT company interview.

## The Professionalism of a Programmer

To become a proficient programmer, consistent practice is essential. This repo also emphasizes the practice of "Kata."

### What is Kata?

Kata (形) is a term borrowed from Japanese martial arts, which refers to a detailed choreographed pattern of movements. In the context of programming, we adapt this concept to mean `small, self-contained coding exercises` that we practice regularly. 

The goal of practicing Kata is not solving problems since we already solved it but to `train our brains and fingers`, allowing programming skills to become instinctive. This approach mirrors the craftsmanship ethos we uphold — similar to how surgeons practice surgical procedures daily to ensure precision and efficiency.

### Daily Practice

Just as a surgeon practices with the same level of focus and precision whether in a training environment or the operating room, we believe that programmers should also train diligently. <u>Through repeated practice, we aim to reach a level of proficiency where writing clean, efficient, and bug-free code becomes second nature</u>.

### Commitment to Craftsmanship

This repo is a testament to the dedication required to master the craft of programming. Each Kata we practice is a step towards excellence, embodying the meticulous attention to detail that defines a professional programmer.

Join us on this journey to technical mastery by incorporating Kata into your daily coding routine.
